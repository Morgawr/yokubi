# The て form

Don't worry if this lesson seems hard. We're just covering fundamentals, you're not expected to internalize the ideas here yet. 

There is a verb form that ends in て. This verb form is used in two main ways:

- to chain actions or statements together
- to provide additional nuance to an action or statement

The て form is made by replacing the past tense た with て. Keep in mind that this isn't some kind of secondary past tense. The て form does not encode any notion of “tense” in its form. It doesn’t tell us anything about the sentence being past or present. 

<pre>
殺<b>して</b>　切<b>って</b>　買<b>って</b>　死<b>んで</b>　食<b>べて</b>
</pre>

The godan verb 行く is an exception and its て form is 行って. 

Adjectives can also have a て form. This is done by turning the い into くて.

<pre>
赤い	赤くて
怖い	怖くて
面白い	面白くて
いい	よくて
</pre>

The adjective いい is an exception and it becomes よくて.

This also works for negative conjugations, which is also how we apply て form to negative verbs.

<pre>
赤くない	赤くなくて
食べない	食べなくて
</pre>

We saw “A is B” and “A does B” type of sentences. With the introduction of the て form we will see our first example of “A does B and C” type of sentences. At the very basic syntax level, AてB means “To do A, and then do B”. It can mark either a temporal sequence, or a cause \-\> consequence relationship. It allows us to make longer sentences with multiple verbs in sequence. 

<pre>
物分りがよく<b>て</b>助かる   
You have a good understanding <b>and</b> it helps

彼女の目を見<b>て</b>、頷いた  
I looked her in the eyes <b>and</b> I nodded
</pre>

Note: whether or not you use a comma after て does not matter. Commas in general have no grammatical role in Japanese, but they can make things easier to parse.

In the first example, the statement 物分りがよくて is followed by the statement 助かる. 助かる is not modifying よくて. Instead, the first statement is setting up the context for the second statement. It is common in Japanese to build an initial statement, followed by a て conjugation, and then an additional statement that describes your subjective feeling or emotion about that first statement. You feel relieved (助かる) because the other person has the quality of 物分りがいい. 

The second example just strings the statements together as a simple sequence of actions. As mentioned earlier, the て form does not provide any notion of past or present tense. The tense is instead conveyed by the last verb in the sequence. 頷いた in the second example is in past form, so we can assume that the entire statement is in past tense. 

Sometimes the て form lets a verb act as a topic. In this way, it can look like a noun. It's not really a noun, it just looks like one in situations like this. In this usage it is often followed by the は particle. 

<pre>
食べ<b>ては</b>いい  
It's good to eat.
</pre>

The て form of ない, なくて, often carries a "didn't X, so Y" nuance. But this is just a nuance. It's just one of the possible uses of it.

<pre>
早く起き<b>なくて</b>仕事に遅れた  
I didn't get up early, and I was late for work. (reason)
</pre>
