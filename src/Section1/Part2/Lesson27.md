# Saying "if" with ば

Japanese has many ways to say “if” and provide conditional statements. In this lesson we will learn one that is probably the simplest of them. Don’t try to memorize this completely, as it will become easier to understand once we’ll cover the other options too. 

The order of conditionals in Japanese state first the condition, and then the resulting action. Conditionals are one way we can connect two “A does B” type of sentences, in a structure like “If A does B, then C does D”. Obviously, structures like “If A is B, then C does D” or any other combinations are acceptable too.

Verbs have a ば form that turns them into a condition. The conjugation turns the u at the end of a verb into an e, then adds ば. Basically, for godan verbs, you replace the u with an e, and for ichidan verbs, you add れ after the stem.

見<b>れば</b>死ぬ
<b>If</b> you look you'll die.

こいつを殺せ<b>ば</b>いいの？
Is it okay <b>if</b> I kill this dude?
</pre>

ば implies that the condition is sufficient for the result to come to happen. It’s a true logical “if”. This can even be used for certain requests, like "If you're late, just call and I'll handle everything". However, ば doesn't imply that the condition will eventually happen, so it can’t be used in things like "When you come around, come see me". We'll see other conditionals that are more appropriate for this type of sentence later.

For the ば conditional of the copula だ, we need to “expand” it into である and conjugate that instead.

普通の人<b>であれば</b>、その命令に逆らうことはできないだろう  
If he were a normal person, he surely would not be able to go against that order.
